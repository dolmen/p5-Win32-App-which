=over 4

=item *

the current directory is explored before PATH

=item *

the extensions specified in PATHEXT are added to the given filename to find an
executable file matching the command

=back


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item C<-a>

print all pathnames instead of only the first one

=back
