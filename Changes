Revision history for Win32::App::which.

1.01    2011-03-28  Olivier Mengué (DOLMEN)
        Refactoring leading to huge (x8) speed improvement.

1.00    2011-03-21  Olivier Mengué (DOLMEN)
        Completely rewrote which.cmd to fix major issues:
        - show multiple files only with '-a'
        - file list was not ordered according to PATH in case of multiple
          matches in one directory
        - add '--'
        - add support for '-a'
	Add 'which.pod' for documentation.
        Note that license is GNU GPL 3.0 or later, but some Module::Build bugs
          block from specifying it in META.json.
